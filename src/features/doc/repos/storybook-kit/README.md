# storybook-kit

A Storybook for your design system that looks like a designer made it.

storybook-kit is a pre-styled Storybook template, a getting-started guide, and
a set of agent skills. Together they take you from a Figma file to a
documented component library you can share as a link. The kit is for
designers who build with an AI agent (Claude Code or Cursor) and would rather
not learn how Storybook works inside.

## How it works

1. **Build.** Give your agent a Figma frame. It builds the component in code,
   using color and type tokens that match your Figma variables.
2. **Document.** Each component gets a docs page with a live example, usage
   guidelines, do's and don'ts shown side by side, and accessibility notes.
   You write the guidance in plain words, and your agent lays it out.
3. **Share.** Publish the Storybook as a website and send the link to your
   team. Designers and developers read the same pages.

> Status: early. The shell is in `template/` and the guide is in
> [`docs/getting-started.md`](docs/getting-started.md). The skills come next;
> see [`plans/001-brief.md`](plans/001-brief.md).

## What is in it

- **The shell.** A Storybook with a calm interface: a clean sidebar, light and
  dark themes, and docs pages for anatomy, usage and do's and don'ts. You set
  the name, logo, fonts and sidebar colors in one file.
- **The guide.** Every step from an empty laptop to a running Storybook,
  written for people who have never opened a terminal.
- **The skills (coming next).** Instructions your agent follows to set up the
  kit, pull tokens from Figma variables, turn a Figma frame into a documented
  component, and publish the result as a link.
